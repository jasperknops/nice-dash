ABOUT
-----
This module makes the lifes of editors and webmasters a bit easier. We want to make it as easy as possible for Drupal end-users to have all the tools at a central spot. In trainings with customers it was sometimes very hard to explain how to get at the right spots to alter content. As a webmaster they can create a dashboard with all the widgets you think are needed the most. 

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
We use this module in combination with the Rubik theme from Develomentseed (http://code.developmentseed.org/rubik/node/239), it simply looks clean in this theme. We also use the admin 2 module which is at this moment still in development (http://drupal.org/project/admin).
